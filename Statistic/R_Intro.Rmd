## The R Software Environment 

As [The R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/) states :

 > R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. 
 
 >R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
 
 and
 
 > R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes
  - an effective data handling and storage facility,
  -  a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
  -  a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
  -  graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
  -  a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.


### Install R 

To install R visit [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
and follow the link and the instructions for your operative system. 

### R basics

- R files have the `.R` extension. 

- To enter R interactive console just execute `R` in the linux terminal or in
Windows command line.

- Once the R console is active you can type R commands. 

- Use `q()` to quit. 

- Use `Rscript filename.R` to execute an R source file. 

- use `source(filename.R)` to load an R file in the current 
session.

### R packages

R comes with a lot of basic functions (mathematical, statistical), but the
real strength of R is the huge ecosystem of packages. 

#### Install packages

To install a package we can use the R call 
`install.packages("name of the package")`. 

This will install the given package from the official R repository 
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

Some packages are available only from the alternative repository 
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/), to install this packages you need 
first to install Bioconductor with the command
`source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")` and the call the function
`biocLite("name of the package")`.
You can find the extensive list of packages available in Bioconductor 
[here](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software).

#### Load a package 

Before using the functions of a given installed package we need to load it
into the current session. To do so we use the `library` function as,
```{r}
library(parallel) ##load the parallel package for parallel computing
```
### R help and package documentation

R functions and packages are extensively documented, even if, especially for
beginners, read the documentation can be slightly confusing. It is important
to learn how to extract information from the help. 

If you want to display the documentation relative to a given function, it is
sufficient to call `?name.of.the.function`,
```{r}
?plot
```

If we want to search the entire R (and packages) documentation for a given 
expression we can use the `??` operator as in,
```{r}
??"linear model"
```

We can restrict the search to a given package with the 
`??package.name::search.string` syntax,
```{r}
??utils::"help" ## search pages with the "help" string in the utils package
```


### R resources 

-  [https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)


## Rstudio 

R can be used directly via command line and with a very basic text editor but 
the use of the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is much easier and strongly suggested. 


### Install RStudio 

To install the Rstudio editor just choose the appropriate installer from the 
[download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### Rstudio interface

![R studio interface](R_Intro_1.png)


The default Rstudio interface it is usually divided in four areas:

- A: The Source Pane, here we can edit the source files (.R) or other 
      text files. We can execute a part of a source file by selecting it and pressing 
      Ctrl + Enter. 
- B: The console Pane, here is shown the R console, the output of R commands will be shown here, and we can also directly execute here some R code. 
- C: The upper right pane contains information on the workspace (that is the 
      set of object defined) and the command history. 
      From this pane we can clean all the workspace, save it or load a previous saved workspace. 
- D: The lower right pane contains other tools. The more useful is the Plots 
(where plot are shown) and the Help (packages documentation).   


## The R language 

### Comments

In R, comments are added starting with a `#` character,
```{r}
### Comments are useful to explain the code, improve readability and 
### add notes to the code files

# this is a comment line
## Now we will sum 10 and 12 and display the result
10 + 12  #the sum 


```

### Variables and assignments 

To assign a value to a variable in R we use `<-`:

```{r}
a <- 1

print(1)
```

In R variables are not typed, that means that we do not have to specify 
beforehand the type of variables we want to assign, moreover a variable can 
change its type, 
```{r}
x <- 100 #here we assign an integer to x
print(x)

x <- "The variable x" #here we assing a string to the same variable x
print(x)
```
This allow us a great flexibility when writing R code, but also we have 
to be careful because it is more easy to write code that produce errors,
```{r}
x <- "this is a string"

try(1 + x, silent = F, outFile = stdout())   ## just a way to show that 1 + x return and error
```


It is also possible to use `=` to assign a variable, but culturally in R `<-` is 
usually the most common way. 

There exist also the *right* assignment operator `->` :
```{r}
12 -> x

x + 1
```

It can be useful to work in the console, but for clarity is better to avoid it 
while writing code. 

To print in console the value of a variable `x` we can use the `print(x)` function
or just type the name of the variable. 

```{r}
print(x)
```

#### Types of variables

In R there are different types of variables, to check the type of a variable 
we can use the `typeof` function. 

Numeric values are represented as `double`:
```{r}
v <- 5
typeof(v)
```

Logical values `TRUE` and `FALSE`,
```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
```

The values `TRUE` and `FALSE` can also be expressed as `T` and `F`. 


Complex numbers:
```{r}
z <- 1 + 3i 
typeof(z)
```


Characters,
```{r}
typeof("Hello")
```

##### {.exercise}

1. Define a numeric variable and print its value to console. 
2. Find how to extract the imaginary part of a complex number (use the help).

### Arithmetic operations and basic math functions {.tabset}

The usual arithmetic operation and math functions are implemented in R. 

#### Sum
```{r}
1 + 2
10 - 3 
```

#### Multiplication and division
```{r}
20 * 2 
10/3
3^2
```

#### Integer division
```{r}
10 %/% 3 #integer division
10 %% 3 # 10 mod 3
```

#### Logarithms and exponentials

```{r}
exp(2.5)

log(10)

log2(16) #logarithm in base 2

log10(100)
```

##### {.exercise}
1. Compute $\ln(x)$ for $x= -1 , 1, 2$.
2. Compute $e^{x^2}$ for $x= 1,2$ . 

#### Trigonometric functions

```{r}
sin(2*pi) ##it is zero ....

cos(pi)
```

##### {.exercise}

1. Compute the value of $\cos(x)$ for $x = 0, \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi, 2\pi$.
2. Compute $\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)$ for different values of x. 

### Logical operators

In R we can test equality or inequalities similarly to other 
programming languages

Inequalities:
```{r}
1 < 2
10 >= 10 
-1 > 10 
```

Equality:
```{r}
v <- 1
v == 1
v != 2
v != 1

a <- "hello"
a == "hello"
a == "Hello"
a != "aaaa"
```

We can join two or more statements with `&` (AND) or with `|` (OR):
```{r}
x <- 10 

(x < 100) & (x > 0) # x smaller than 100 AND greater than 0

(x > 100) | (x < 0) # x greater than 100 OR smaller than 0
```

We can negate a statement with the `!` operator:
```{r}
!(x == 1) # NOT (is x equal to 1)
```

We can also assign the value of a comparison to a variable:
```{r}
x <- 5
test <- x == 4  #now in the variable test we have a value (TRUE or FALSE)
!test #negate the boolean variable test
```

##### {.exercise}

1. Check if in R if $\sin(0) = 0$.
2. Check if $\sin(2\pi) = 0$. 
3. Check if $e^{\ln(x)} = x$ for $x = 1,2,3,4$. 

### Vectors

Vectors can be created with the command 
`c(el1, el2, el3, ..., eln)` as in:
```{r}
v <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
print(v)
```

The function `c()` is really the concatenation opeartion, but it is 
useful to create vectors. 

To check the length of a vector we use the function `length`:
```{r}
length(v)
```
The elements in a vector are obtained with `v[i]`, the index of the element starts
with 1:
```{r}
v[1]
v[2]
```

#### Vector operations

Almost all operations and function in R are vectorized, that is they can be 
executed on a vector, component-wise. 

We can sum tow vectors:
```{r}
x <- c(3, 1, 5, -2.4, 5.4, 1.2, -15.6) #define a vector x
y <- c(2, 0, 4, 2, -1, 0 , 0) #define a vector y with the same lenght as x

x + y #compute the sum component-wise

```

We can multiply them:
```{r}
x*y
```

Or divide:
```{r}
x/y 
```

Or compute a mathematical function:
```{r}
abs(x)
```

#### Subsetting a vector

We saw that to select the $i$th element of a vector `v` we just use the `[]` 
operator:
```{r}
v <- c(3, 2, 5, 7, 4, 3)
v[3] 

v[3] <- 0 ## this assign 0 to the 3rd position of the vector
v
```

How we can now extract all the elements of the vector `v` that satisfy 
some condition. For example all the element smaller than 5.
If we write
```{r}
v < 5 
```
we obtain a vector of logical values indicating for every element of the vector `v` if the condition `<5` is fulfilled. 

We can now use this vector of logical values to obtain a subset of the original vector:
```{r}
v[ v<5 ]
```

We can also select a subset of element with the corresponding indexes :
```{r}
v[ c(1,3)] #the first and the third element
```

And we can exclude some of the element:
```{r}
v[-2] #all but the 2 element

v[-c(1,3)] #all but the first and third element
```

###### {.exercise}

1. Define a vector with `v <- runif(1000)`. Now find the proportion of elements of
the vectors that are less than $0.15$.
2. For the same vector `v` substitute all the elements less than $0.15$ with
 the value $-1$. 

#### Joining vectors

To join two vectors just use the `c()` function:
```{r}
v1 <- c(1,2)

v2 <- c(3,4,5)

c(v1,v2)
```


#### Sequences

Sequences of integers or of equally spaced values are very useful and in R there
are easy ways to create them. 

One of the most basic way is the colon operator `a:b` that generates
regular sequences with steps equals to $1$ or $-1$.
```{r}
1:10 
```

```{r}
8:(-3)
```

The generalization of the colon operator `:` is the function `seq` 
```{r}
seq(from = 0, to = 4 , by = 0.25) ## specifying the step 
```

```{r}
seq(from = 0, to = 4, length.out = 7) ##specifying the length of the sequences
```

###### {.exercise}

1. Create a sequence of length $100$ from $0$ to $13$ without using `seq` 
(use instead `:` and arithmetic operations between vectors).
2. Use now `seq` to create the same sequence as in 1. and compare the results 
   (you can test it with `all()`).
3. Create a sequence from $-1$ to $0$ by step of length $0.013$ and then 
a sequence of length $12$ from $0$ to $1$, finally join the two sequences.  

#### Sums and products

Sometimes we need to sum or multiply all the elements of a vector, we can thus 
use the built-in functions `sum` and `prod`,
```{r}
v <- 1:10
sum(v)

prod(v)
```

### Matrices 

To create matrices in R we can use the `matrix() ` function, that takes as 
arguments: `data` the vector of element of the matrix, `nrow` the number of rows,
`ncol` the number of columns. 

```{r}
matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4,5,6) , nrow = 2 )
```

as we can see the matrix if filled  column by column. If we prefer to fill it 
row-wise we need to specify the argument `byrow = TRUE`:

```{r}
matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4,5,6) , nrow = 2 , byrow = TRUE)
```

The `data` arguments is recycled if needed, so for example to create a matrix
with constant elements is very easy:
```{r}
A <- matrix(data = 5, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
print(A)
```

To obtain the number of rows and/or columns from a matrix, use the functions 
`nrow()` and `ncol`,
```{r}
nrow(A)
ncol(A)
```

Or you can obtain both numbers directly with the function `dim`,
```{r}
dim(A)
```
#### Subsetting a matrix

To access and modify elements of a matrix we use the `[]` operator,
```{r}
M <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12), nrow=4) #matrix with 4 rows and 3 columns
M[1,1] ## the element in the first row and first column

M[3,1]
```

If we want to extract an entire row,
```{r}
M[2,] #the second row
```

or a column,
```{r}
M[,1]
```

If you want to extract a sub matrix just specify the indexes,
```{r}
subM <- M[c(1,3), c(1,2)]
print(subM)
```


#### The `diag` function

The `diag` function in R can be used for different purposes. 

First of all it can extract the diagonal of a matrix,
```{r}
A <- matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2)
A
diag(A)
```

Similarly, can be used to set the diagonal of a matrix to a new value,
```{r}
diag(A) <- c(10,20)
A
```

Moreover, can be used to create diagonal matrices, in this case the argument 
has to be a vector or a numerical value,
```{r}
diag(c(1,2,3,4))
```

We can thus use the `diag` function to create the identity matrix,
```{r}
diag(1, nrow=3)
```

##### {.exercise}

1. Create a $10 \times 10$ matrix with the R command 
`matrix(rnorm(100),nrow = 10)` and assign it to a variable. 
2. Compute the trace (sum of the elements in the diagonal) of the matrix.
3. Compute the trace of the $3 \times 3$ sub-matrix of the first 3 rows and the last 3 columns.
4. Create a diagonal $1000 \times 1000$ matrix such that the diagonal 
is the sequence of numbers  $a_i = \frac{1}{i^2}$. 
5. Can we use the functions `sum` and `prod` with matrices? How do they work?

### List

Lists or "generic vectors" are another type of data. A list is a set of 
(possibly named) elements. Each element can be any type of R object (e.g a vector
, a matrix, another list etc.. ).
To create a list we use the function `list()`, where the arguments are the 
elements of the list. 

For example here we create a list with elements: a vector of length 2, a 
diagonal $3 \times 3$ matrix, and a string.
```{r}
l <- list(c(1,2), diag(1, nrow=3), "I am a string")
print(l)
```

To access an element of a list we use the `[[]]` operator:
```{r}
l[[3]]
```

The `[]` operator will instead output the sub-list with the given indexes:
```{r}
l[c(1,3)]
```

Lists are probably more used when the element have names, to create a list with
named elements, we just specify them in the `list()` function:
```{r}
l <- list(vec = c(1,2), matr = diag(1, nrow=3), mystring = "I am a string")
```

Now we can access the elements with the `$` operator, using their names:

```{r}
l$mystring
```

We can also create new elements (or modify existing ones),
```{r}
l$newString <- "AAAA"
```

The function `length` returns the number of elements in a list,
```{r}
length(l)
```
##### {.exercise}

1. Create a list of length 2 with elements named `"mon"` and `"wed"` 
where in each element we record the number of hours of this course 
(3 for Monday and 2 for Wednesday).
2. How we could now also record the information for the number 
of exercise hours? (a vector? a list?)
3. Add now another element named `"tot"` to the list in point 1. and record 
there the total number of hours. 


### Data frames

Data frames are probably the most useful data structure when dealing with
statistical problems. As the name suggests they represent a data set of 
observations over different variables. 

From the point of view of R, data frames are somehow like a matrix (they have 
two dimensions, rows and columns) but as we will see they also are similar to 
lists in the way we can extract some of the values. 

To create a data frame we can use the `data.frame` function

```{r}
DF <- data.frame(A = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0), B = c(100, 98 , 99, 100, 110))
print(DF)
```

We can access elements of a data frame in exactly the same way as matrices,
```{r}
DF[3,2]
```

But we can also use the name of the variables,
```{r}
DF[4, "A"]
```

And we can extract the column corresponding to a variable, using the `$` 
operator, similarly to lists,
```{r}
DF$B 
```

#### Extracting observations 

Given a dataset we need sometimes to extract some of the observations (rows) 
given some criteria. Lets see now some examples, we will use the following data
frame with 4 variables and 10 observations.
```{r}
DF <- data.frame( X = as.factor(c(1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1)),
                  Y = c(13, 10, 5, 23 , 32, 7, 19, 6, 11, 3),
                  Z = c(-2, 1, 0, 2, -3, 0, 2, 1, -2, -1),
                  W = c(0.3, 0.1, 1.3, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 1)) 
DF
```

Extract the observations such that $X = 1$ can be done by,
```{r}
   DF[ DF$X == 1, ]  
```

Extract the observations where $Y > 10$,
```{r}
  DF[ DF$Y > 10, ]
```

Extract the observations where $Y>10$ and $Z < 0$
```{r}
  DF[ DF$Y > 10 &  DF$Z < 0, ]
```
##### {.exercise}
1. Load the dataset `trees` with the command `data(trees)`. 
   You can now find it in the variable `trees`.
2. How many variables are in the dataset? How many observations? 
3. Compute the sum of the variable `Volume` for all the observations. 
4. Count how many trees (observations) have a recorded height lower than $70$. 
   Can you do it in just one line of code? 

### `if else` statement

Lets introduce now the basic form of control flow in R, the `if else` statement. 

As in other programming language the `if (cond) cons.expr  else alt.expr` 
will test if a condition (`cond`) is `TRUE`, if so it will execute the
first expression (`cons.exp`) otherwise it will execute the second 
expression (`alt.expr`). The `else alt.expr` part can be omitted and in this 
case just the first expression (`cons.expr`) will be executed if the condition is
fulfilled. 

For example lets use the `if else` statement to test if a number is positive 
before applying the square root,
```{r}
x <- 10

if (x > 0){
  print(sqrt(x))
} else {
  print("Negative number")
}
```

```{r}
x <- -5

if (x > 0){
  print(sqrt(x))
} else {
  print("Negative number")
}
```
### `for` loop

Through the `for` statement is possible to perform the same expression for
different values of a variable. 

For example with a `for` we can sum all the elements of a vector 
(surely we already saw a better way...):
```{r}
v <- c(10, 15, -1, 0)

tot <- 0
for (a in v){
  tot <- tot + a 
}
print(tot)

```

It is common to use the `for` coupled with the `:` operator or the `seq` 
function, 
```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  print(paste("this is the", i, "iteration"))
}
```

```{r}
tot <- 0
for (x in seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)){
  tot <- tot + x^3
}
print(tot)
```
##### {.exercise}
1. Write a code to compute $100! = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots 99 \cdot  100$.

### Functions 

As every programming language, we can define new functions in R using the 
following syntax,
```{r}
myNewFun <- function(arg1, arg2 = 2, arg3 = NA){
  #some computations
  #
  # example:  
  res <- arg1 + arg2 
  #
  # return the result
  return(res)
} 
```

####  Arguments of a function 

The arguments of a function are declared when we define it, we can add 
default values to the arguments, in this case if the argument is not 
assigned when the function is called, the default value will be used. 

```{r}
f_sum <- function(a, b = 0){
   a + b  #we can omit the return statement, 
          #the function will return the last computed value
}

f_sum(1, 3)

f_sum(2)
```

We can also explicitly name the arguments when we call a function,
```{r}
f_sum(b = 4, a = 1)
```


##### {.exercise}

1. Write a function that return the product of two numbers
2. Write a function that given a vector `x` return a vector with the 
maximum and minimum values of `x` 
3. Write a function that given a $2 \times 2$ matrix returns its determinant.
If the matrix is square of dimensions grater than $2$, it prints the string 
`Can't compute determinants of n x n matrices` 
where `n` is the 
dimension.
If the matrix is not a square matrix it prints the string `Can't compute 
determinants of rectangular matrices`.

#### {}

We can also have functions that do not accept any arguments as,
```{r}
f_hello_world <- function(){
  print("Hello world")
}
```

or,
```{r}
f_const <- function(){
  return(5)
}

```

#### Return value

Functions can return every R object but just one object, sometimes it is useful to
return a named list when we want to return more than one value. 

```{r}
f_summary <- function(x) {
  l <- list()
  l$mean <- mean(x)
  l$var <- var(x)
  l$max <- max(x)
  l$min <- min(x)
  return(l)
}

f_summary(rnorm(100))
```




### `apply`, `lapply`, `sapply` 

The `for` loops can be extremely slow in R, when is possible code should be
vectorized and in the majority of case `for` loops can be replaced by
`apply`, `lapply` or `sapply` functions. 

#### `lapply`

`lapply` apply the same function to every element of a list (or vector) `X` and 
return  a list of the same length with the returned values. 

For example we can use `lapply` to create different sequences with different 
lenghts,
```{r}
lapply( 1:10, function(i) 1:i  )
```

or to performa some operations on a list of lists,
```{r}
classroom <- list(
student1 = list( grade1 = 8, grade2 = 6 , name = "Niels" ),
student2 = list( grade1 = 7, grade2 = 4, name = "Julia" ),
student3 = list( grade1 = 4, grade2 = 6, name = "Chris") 
)

grades1 <- lapply( classroom, function(stud) return(stud$grade1))
grades1
```

`lapply` can also be used with data.frames, in this case the elements are 
the columns of the data.frame. 

```{r}
D <- data.frame( A = rnorm(100), B = runif(100), C = runif(100))

lapply(D, sum) #obtain the sum of the observations of A, B, C 
```

##### {.exercise}

1. Use `lapply` to build $100$ identity matrices of different dimensions 
ranging from 1 to 100. 

#### `sapply`

`sapply` is a simplified version of lapply that convert the return object to 
a vector.

For example in the last example of the classroom,
```{r}
sapply( classroom, function(stud) return(stud$grade1))

1. Use `sapply` to compute $k!$ for $k = 1, \ldots, 100$

#### `apply`

`apply` return a vector or an array of values obtained by applying a function to 
the marginal of an array, matrix or a data.frame. 
It is useful for example to apply a function
to all the columns or rows of a matrix or a dataframe. 

```{r}
m <- matrix(data = rnorm(100), nrow = 20) # a 20 x 5 matrix

apply(m, MARGIN = 1, sum) #obtain the row-wise sums

apply(m, MARGIN = 2, sum) #obtain the column-wise sums
```

### Plots 

With R is very easy to create various plots. The principal function is obviously
`plot()` that works with different arguments. We will see now some of the most 
basic examples:

#### Points and lines

We can give the x-y coordinates of the point we want to plot
```{r}
x <- seq(from =-10, to = 10, by = 0.25)
y <- x^3 - 3*x^2 + 2*x
plot(x,y, col = "red")
```

If we use the argument `type = "l"` instead of plotting the points, lines 
connecting two consecutive points will be plotted. 
```{r}
plot(x,y, col = "red", type = "l" )
```
 
#### Adding points or lines to a plot

Sometimes we want to add some new element to a already produced plot, 
for example if we want to draw the graph of two functions in the same plot. 
TO do so we can use the functions `points()` or `lines()`.

```{r}
plot(x, x^2, type = "l", col = "red", ylim = c(-10,10))
lines(x, x^3, col = "blue")
lines(x, x^4, col = "green")
legend("right",legend = c("x^2","x^3","x^4"), col = c("red", "blue", "green"), 
       lty = c(1,1,1))
```


#### Plotting functions

If we have a function `f` that return a numerical value and accept a numerical value as an input 
(that is, an R function the implement a mathematical real function 
$f:\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ ), we can plot it directly with a single plot call,

```{r}
f <- function(x){
  return(50*sin(x) ^ 2 + x ^ 3)
}

g <- function(x){
  return(50*cos(x) + x ^ 2)
}
plot(f, from = -5, to = 10, col = "blue")
plot(g, from = -5, to = 10, col = "red", add = TRUE)
```

We used the argument `add = TRUE` to add the second plot to the first one. 

Sometimes it is useful to use the `curve` function to plot mathematical functions,

```{r}
curve( 1 + sin(x), from = -3, to = 4)
```

#### {.exercise}

1. Plot the graph of the function $f(x)=ln(1 + |x|) + x^2$ without 
using the `curve` function or the plotting of a function. 
2. Plot (in the interval $[-5,5]$) the graphs of the functions $f(x)=\alpha \sin(\alpha x)$ for 
$\alpha=1,\ldots,10$, use different colors for each value of the parameter 
$\alpha$. Be careful to show the graphs of all the functions in the plot. 
For some values of the parameter the graph shown is not very *smooth*, how we can 
improve the plotting?


## Code style 

It is important to keep the code readable for this reason we can follow some 
simple rule.

1. Put a space between binary operator as `<-` , `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%*%` .

Badly formatted code:
```{r}
a<-1
b<-3
c<-(a+b)/(a*5)+b/(a-2)-6/b
```
 
Niceley formatted:
```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- (a + b) / (a * 5) + b / (a - 2) - 6 / b
```

2. Put a space after a comma and never before.

3. Avoid very long lines, in R you can split long commands in different lines,

```{r}
f_lot_args <- function(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l){
  return(f)
}

f_lot_args( a = 1, b = c(1,2,3,4,5), c = "IamAstring",
           d = 3, e = 1212413513514143135 , 
           f = list( A = c(1, 2, 3), B = c(1, 2, 3)),
           g = 1, h = 2, i = 3,
           l = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) )
```

3. Avoid very long *script* files, that is just long list of R commands. 
   Split your code in small functions and different file, you can then 
   `source` the needed functions' files.

### Formatting code in Rstudio

In Rstudio you can reformat your code form the **Code** menu or using the 
`Ctr + Shift + A` shortcut, it will usually do a nice job.
